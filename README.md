# RESTy
401 js React project

Right now i am only making a form that takes in a url and has 4 buttons for API calls and a text box to display the selection beneath it.

### UML

As shown in the uml: everything lives in index.js, and everything is being called in to the index js after being created. In a way every component is being nested inside.
